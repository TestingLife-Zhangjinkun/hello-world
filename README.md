Hi everyone, I am @TestingLife - Zhangjinkun and I have been working on software testing for more than **15 years**. My interests are mainly in the technical research related to **software testing** and **test tool development**. I have some scientific achievements in the field of software automation testing, especially in bus communication interface based software automation testing, and automatic test data generation, see [my ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4506-3235) for details.

This project is a lightweight data simulation test framework proposed for bus communication-based software. It supports the flexible construction of a semi-physical simulation test environment, simple operation, and easy implementation of automated testing. The purpose of building this project is, on the one hand, to share the author's experience in equipment software testing, on the other hand, to work with collaborators from all over the world for the progress of the software testing industry.


Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
