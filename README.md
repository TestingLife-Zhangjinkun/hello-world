Hi everyone, I am @TestingLife - Zhangjinkun and I have been working on software testing for more than **15 years**. My interests are mainly in the technical research related to **software testing** and **test tool development**. I have some scientific achievements in the field of software automation testing, especially in bus communication interface based software automation testing, and automatic test data generation, see [my ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4506-3235) for details.

This project is a lightweight data simulation test framework proposed for bus-based communication software. The purpose is to share the author's many years of experience in testing equipment software on the one hand and to work on the progress of the software testing industry with collaborators around the world on the other.

Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
